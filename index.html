    <p>In the beginning of my school career I didnt really know what path I wanted to take
        I've always had an interest in technology ever since I was a kid. Technology was all I knew growing up.
        Growing up during the vast technology advancment has put me in a great place to start.
        I've always liked video games, computers, pretty much anything with a battery. 
        However as I get older I see myself drifting towards the cyber security and development of products.
        How things are protected, firewalls, passwords, and malware prevention.
        The main thing i've learned is cyber security mainly use Java, JavaScript, Python, SQL, Powershell, and many others.
